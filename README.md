# Carduino

This repository contains the source code for the Carduino library for Arduino IDE as well as design files for the electronics and the 3d printed enclosure for the Carduino device.  Each of these 3 components will be desctibed separately below.  More information about Carduino can be found at https://carduino.co

## Arduino library
The Arduino IDE can be downloaded here:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
The files that make up the library are under the src folder.

## PCB design files
The PCB is designed using Eagle.  It meets the criteria for being edited using the free edition for personal use, which can be downloaded here:
https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/eagle/free-download
The PCB design files can be found in the eagle folder.

## Enclosure 3d model
The enclosure was designed with TinkerCad.  Unfortunately, TimcarCad does not support saving the native files, but the exported .stl files can be imported and tweaked as you wish at:
